/*
    DYNAMIC MEMORY = Memory that is allocated after the prograam is already compiled & running.
    1. Use the "new" operator to allocate memory in the heap rather than the stack.
    2. Useful when we don't kno how much memory we will need.
    3. Makes our programs more flexible especiaally when accepting user input.
